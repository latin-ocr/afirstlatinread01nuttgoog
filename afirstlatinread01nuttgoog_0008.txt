PREFACE

Wrrn the Primer previously published, this Reader pro·
vides ior a course ol study leading up to Caesar or some
other author of like difficulty. Students who are to give

sequence, the Reader will be lound to meet the needs of

exercises are massed at one point, with notes at the ioot of
the page.

Teachers using the Reader can best cooperate toward
realizing the writer’s airn if each recitation period is divided
definitely into two parts, the first to be devoted, without
distraction, to the business of learning to read, the other
being reserved ior grammatical drill and lor composition
work, oral or written. In this way, without loss in any

’ essential particular, it will be lound possible to bring the

student along, by natural stages, to the point where he will ·
