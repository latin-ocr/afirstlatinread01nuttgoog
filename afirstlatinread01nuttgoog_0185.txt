(suurn netum carrum, 40, 41, to)

LESSON 134

lu 63 nc. Marcus Cicero (brother os the Quintus Cicero who sub·
sequently tigured in the events described in Lesson 108 ff.) had to deal

with a rather alanning conspiracy which aimed to revolutionize the gov-
ernment of Rome. The chief conspirator, Catiline, took the field with

an army, while Lentulus, who was secretly in sympathy with him, su-
pervised matters in the city. One day Lentulus noticed there two Gallie
envoys who had come to Rome to complain that Roman officials were
oppressing their people, and he thereupon conceived the idea of
further embarrassing the government by inducing these Gauls to stir
up a revolt among their countrymen.
