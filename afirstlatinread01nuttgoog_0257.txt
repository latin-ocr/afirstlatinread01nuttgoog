OR convenience this edition of Cicero has been pub-

lished in two t‘orms. The larger edition includes the

four orations against Catiline, the Manilian law, Archias,
Marcellus, Ligarius, and the Fourteenth Philippic. The
smaller edition contains the first six of these orations, which
are those required by the College Entrance Examination
Board, and by the New Yorlr State Education Department.
ql Before the text of each oration is a special introduction,
which is intended to awalren the interest of the student by
furnishing him with information in regard to the oration.
{l The general introduction presents an outline of the life of
Cicero, a brief history of Roman oratory, a chronological table
of contemporaneous Roman history,a short account of the
main divisions of the Roman people, the powers and the
duties of magistrates, of the senate, of the popular assemblies,
and of the courts of justice.
Ἥ The notes give the student the lsey to all really difficult pas·
sages, and at the same time furnish him with such collateral
information upon Roman manners and customs, upon Roman
history and life, as will enable him to understand, appreciate,
and enjoy these masterpieces of Roman oratory. ‘l‘he gram-
matical references are to all the standard Latin grammars.
ἺῙ The vocabulary gives the primary meanings of words, with
such other meanings as the student will ncel in translating
the orations. Special attention is devoted to the important
subject of etymology. There are many maps and illustrations.
