iv FIRST LATIN READER

attack a simple passage from Caesar or Nepos, not as a
Chinese puzzle by laborious effort to be tortured into some-
thing remotely resembling sense, but as a story from the
reading oi which some pleasure and profit is to be derived.

For the development oi a system of Latin-English
exercises so graded as to serve the purpose ior which the
Reader is made, oi course no Latin author was available;
and the text, therefore, is necessarily ior the most part
original. With' the idea of stimulating interest, and to
bring into play the necessary vocabulary and syntax while
yet meeting halfway the many who do “not care ior (for-

eign) war,” the first hundred lessons have,been made to ³

deal almost entirely with matters oi American history, the
initial series (1-45) summing up brielly and chronologically
the main events of the years 1492—1783, and the second χ
group (46100) comprising short anecdotes assembled ¹
without regard for chronological sequence. Next follow
two narratives from Caesar simplified(101-125), and the
concluding series (126-140) is made up oi selections from
the original text of Caesar, Nepos, Suetonius, Sallust, and
Cicero. This final group, oi course, is not a part oi the
gradatim plan, but was added that the student might have
the satisfaction oi reading some “real Latin.'' The pas
sage irom Suetonius (131), chiefly because of its large
vocabulary, will probably be found too difficult ior most
pupils; ii so, the intrinsic interest oi the passage may
malie it seem worth the teacher’s while bo undertake a
translation for the class.

With a view to discouraging the habit oi constant re·
course to the general vocabulary, a series of lesson prepa-
rations has been provided in the form oi a word list
showing the important new words in each successive exer-
cise: moreover, with the exception oi proper names and
