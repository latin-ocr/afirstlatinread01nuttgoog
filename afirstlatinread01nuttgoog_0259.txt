SELECTIONS FROM
THE WORKS OF OVID

Edited by FRANK J. MILLER, Ph.D. (Yale).⁴
Professor of Latin, University of Chicago

HESE selections are fairly representative, and are

edited 'nr such a way as to tllustrate the style and

subject-matter ol each poem, and at the same time to
show the exact relation of every part to the complete
work.
ἹῙ The book includes over 3,800 lines from the Meta-
morphoses, thus more than meeting the requirements in Ovid
of the College Entrance Examination Board, and in addition
the following: Selections from Heroides, Amores, Ars
Amatoria, Remedia Amoris, Fasti, Tristia, and Epistulae ex
Pont03 Life of Ovid, Poetic Forms of Ovid's Worts; with
notes on the selections, and vocabulary.
Ἡ The notes have been prepared with special reference to
the needs of both the school and the college student. They
include: General assisance in the translation of difficolt
and obscure passages ; judicious references on points of syntax
to all the modern school grammars in common use; notes
and commenta upon points of antiquarian interest; and sug·
gestions and illustrations of the relations of Ovid's stories to
their earlier sources, and especially of their effect upon English
literature.
qlThe vocabulary, which has been prepared especially
for this volume, gives the literal meaning of each word,
and also all of the typical meanings which occur in the
text. Generous assistance in word derivation is offered
as well.
